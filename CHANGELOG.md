## 0.2.1 - 2025-07-05

- Introduce LEMONGraphs as an option for running `minimum_weight_perfect_matching` and make it default.
- Move the BlossomV dispatch of `minimum_weight_perfect_matching` to a package extension as an optional dependency, thus making it possible to install GraphsMatching on systems where BlossomV does not install.
